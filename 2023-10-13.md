<!--

There is nothing here. All that can be seen, from horizon to horizon, is blank, blinding, nothing. You can fill in what the colour of 'nothing' is for yourself. For us, it is a blank white.

Although, to be honest, you should picture it as a lighter colour. Because I was lying before. There is *something* here.

Its colour is black, in contrast to the expansive nothing that surrounds it. There is no pressure here, there might as well not be air, there might as well not be gravity. Not that this place needs any of that boilerplate. This creature-- this *thing* needs no air pressure to keep itself together. It needs no gravity to hold itself to the floor. It need not breathe, it need not eat. It simply just is there. And there it stays.

There is a city. The buildings standing tall, varying shapes, sizes, and colours. Oddly, this city seems to be very self-contained. From the distance that we are currently viewing it from, it is very unnaturally placed. There is no urban sprawl surrounding the borders, there are no roads leading away. If you plucked all of the skyscrapers from the landscape, there would be no civilisation left. And yet, there is a city. A small segment of the vacant and unaltered landscape is covered by a towering mass of infrastructure.

We don't know what this place looks like at day. We only ever have the pleasure of witnessing the beauty of it from dusk to dawn. I'm not entirely sure why. <!-- Now that I think of it, I'm not entirely sure who or what I am. But I will not dwell on these minor concerns. As long as you are here listening to me, I am content without an identity. You... are listening, right? -->

The sun has now set, and the city now shows its true colours. And there are so *many* of them.
It is now impossible to miss the boxed mass of buildings, with its neon glow illuminating the surrounding hills. It shines bright in the night, and it *begs* to be explored. But this place will only get more odd from here.
